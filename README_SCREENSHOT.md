# Screenshot Functionality

## Overview

The NinjaScan dashboard now features dynamic website screenshot capture that works without requiring a backend server. Screenshots are captured using reliable third-party services with multiple fallbacks for maximum reliability.

## How It Works

### 1. **Dynamic Screenshot Capture**
- When you enter a domain and click "Free Scan", the system immediately starts capturing a screenshot of that website
- The screenshot appears as soon as it's available during the scanning process
- No pre-loaded or hardcoded content - everything is based on your input

### 2. **Multiple Fallback Services**
The system tries multiple screenshot services in order until one works:

1. **WordPress mShots** - `https://s0.wp.com/mshots/v1/` (reliable and free)
2. **Microlink API** - `https://api.microlink.io/screenshot` (good fallback)
3. **PagePeeker** - `https://free.pagepeeker.com/v2/thumbs.php` (simple but works)
4. **Screenshot Machine** - `https://api.screenshotmachine.com/` (demo key)
5. **Placeholder** - Custom placeholder if all services fail

### 3. **Smart Loading States**
- **Loading**: Shows spinner while capturing screenshot
- **Success**: Displays the actual website screenshot
- **Error**: Shows error message with domain name
- **Fallback**: Shows placeholder if all services fail

## Testing Instructions

### Basic Testing
1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with popular websites:**
   - Enter `google.com` and click "Free Scan"
   - Enter `github.com` and click "Free Scan"
   - Enter `stackoverflow.com` and click "Free Scan"

3. **Observe the behavior:**
   - Screenshot should start loading immediately when scan begins
   - Website image should appear in the scanning view
   - After scan completes, smaller screenshot appears in results

### Advanced Testing
1. **Test fallback behavior:**
   - Try domains that might not work with the first service
   - System should automatically try the next service

2. **Test error handling:**
   - Try invalid domains (e.g., `invalid-domain-123.com`)
   - Should show appropriate error states

3. **Test different domain formats:**
   - `example.com` (without protocol)
   - `https://example.com` (with protocol)
   - Both should work correctly

## Key Features

✅ **Immediate Screenshot Loading** - Starts when scan button is pressed  
✅ **Multiple Service Fallbacks** - High reliability across different networks  
✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation when services fail  
✅ **Loading States** - Clear visual feedback during capture  
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes  
✅ **Accessibility** - Proper alt text and ARIA labels  

## No Backend Required

This solution works entirely in the browser without requiring:
- Node.js server
- Playwright/Puppeteer setup
- AWS Lambda functions
- Database storage
- API keys (uses free tiers)

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- Fetch API
- ES6 Promises
- Image loading events
- CORS requests

The screenshot services handle CORS properly, so no additional configuration is needed.
